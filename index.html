<div>07/01/2019
</div><div><em>A bright Monday evening, 05: 20pm. Dugbe enroute U.I.</em></div><br><div>It started with mild coughs then little jabs disguised under the pretense of adjusting her posture. Then the leg works began as she stretched out her leg into my space to ensure we made contact. 
</div><div>I simply looked away and kept my eyes out of the window. Then her cough resumed and this time louder. 
</div><div>Really? I said within myself, but I kept my stance not wanting to foil the plot.
</div><div>
</div><div>She was an averagely pretty lady but she made up for the beauty with great "endowments" (if you know you know).  I had earlier hurriedly walked past her on my way to the park and coincidentally we were headed the same way. She ensured she secured the seat beside me in the Micra. 
</div><div>
</div><div>"Bless you", I eventually said to her when the coughs will not subside, and as if my words were the medicine to her coughs, it miraculously stopped. I was still clueless as to what her intentions were till I paid my fare (and paid mine only). After that, her leg that seemed glued to mine lost its glue and immediately went apart. 
</div><div>
</div><div>Was I supposed to have offered to pay her fare? Was that the essence for the whole drama? This will be the second of similar experience with a Micra babe o. What are Micra babes up to nowadays abeg? I will find out...just stay tuned to the series

<br>"Whoosh" was the sound as she spat phlegm out of the window. 
<br>OK, I think I'm in for a treat on this trip, I excitedly told myself. She is one of those carefree ladies and they are fun to ride with. Maybe this one will.... Chai! I said it, she did not even allow me finish my line of thought, she has already started... She is practically now 'undressing' beside me inside the Micra...
<br>
<br>Only heaven knows what kind of heat she must be feeling to the point she is "loosely" losing her dress beside a guy and in a public cab for that matter... 
<br>"Baby gimme assurance o x2", she began to sing. I wondered if it was the one Davido sang or her own version because it does not sound like it. It sounded more like she was passing a message across (to some guy, I don't even want to think it to be me)... 
<br>
<br>Please what assurance is she looking for? What assurances are ladies looking for nowadays? This one is even looking for it inside Micra for that matter. Issokay. What some ladies can do or even do to get material things is really alarming these days. May God help their souls.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>"Shift"! The stern voice repeated. To where? I no dey move an inch, and before I could even finish this line of thought in my mind I was already pinned to the door. All she needed do was push me with her massive 120 kg buttocks and I was no match for the weighty push.
<br>
<br>Ehn ehn! So it has come to the use of bottom power? Issokay. 
<br>I was so pinned to the door that I could not even move my hands talk less of legs. Worst still, the heavyweight lady noticed my condition and seemed pleased with it as she had a grin on her face. She even leaned more to my side as if playing romance but it was a "romantic" crushing and not the kind of romance I wanted at all. 
<br>
<br>But why are people like this? So this is how unfair people can be to seek convenience? Everyone wants space and convenience in life but are we craving them at the expense of others? Inconveniencing others and impeding on other peoplesâ space because you have the (bottom) power to do so? See life o. Issokay, the battle has just begun; slim people versus Fat people inside Micra. We shall see&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Lemme o. When d Bible said "Be still..." This is it. 
<br>Let me just be "still" that she may not even know I'm here.
<br>How can someone be so brute and versatile with abusive words? She completely finished the âabusedâ that even we on the other side felt the harshness. She was on a call when she entered the Micra as the last passenger and the taxi took off.
<br>I just dey bow in respect each time she look my side throughout the trip. 
<br>Lemme o, let me be greeting her like that till I alight, in fact greeting is now my new hobby. If she could so verbally bash someone over the phone like that, how terrible can ours in the car be if she provokes on anyone of us. It won't sha be me. I will not fall victim of such fate. 
<br>
<br>Moments of stillness are good and highly recommended. This is my own time, lemme enjoy it.
<br>
<br>As funny as the story above is, it thought me a vital lesson. Sometimes we need to retreat to some âstillâ place and spend silent moment to meditate. Unfortunately most time we allow only unwholesome circumstances push us to do things we morally should devote to doing; like observing periodic quiet on spiritual, moral and medical retreats.&nbsp;<br></p>
