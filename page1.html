                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Marriage is a serious business that requires proper attention. Many times, we wait till we experience roadblocks in life before we do the right things. Couples need to lay out a solid foundational plan for marriage before and not during wedlock. They are only supposed to build, improve upon and constantly refurbish this plan in their marital journey.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><strong>Just do it!</strong></div><br><div>Those are words of advice you are likely to get from people pushing you into marriage. I'll rather tell you otherwise. Don't "just do it", DO IT with preparedness. Many jump into marriage, fumble in it and tumble out of it with regrets. If only they had prepared for it better.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Jump when ready!</strong></div><br><div>That is my advice for you. Don't let anyone push you into what you are not adequately prepared for. Do it at your own conviction. Don't get pressured into marriage by folks and friends.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Jump and brace for impact!</strong></div><br><div>When ready for marriage, you can then jump and brace for impact. When you get pushed prematurely you may not be able to brace appropriately for its impact but when you jump at your will, the brace is strong. Marriage is not a bed of roses, you will soon be hit with its realities of pain and gain; joy and sorrow; struggle and breakthrough etc, but if you are adequately braced for the jump, you will be able to embrace whatever eventualities  you meet in the marital journey.</div></h3>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>How to build a strong relationship -Part 1</em></strong><br><strong><em><br></em></strong>A childhood friend of mine and I had once built a tree-house during one of our idle moments years back. We exerted a lot of energy into pulling down tree branches and gathering planks needed for the structure. <br><br>Excited by the fun of the project, we began to discuss the so many things we would do inside the tree house when completed. We had chosen a huge mango tree in my friend’s compound to host the tree house. We were too carried away with the frenzy of having a treehouse that we went straight into construction without any architectural plans on how to actualize our tree-house dream on the awkwardly shaped mango tree we had chosen. <br><br>We were soon besotted with a lot of challenges when the construction began. No matter how hard we tried to use our ‘by the moment’ thinking to fit the planks together, the structure kept collapsing on the tree. Not until we resolved to go back to the drawing board to map out an architectural design of how the house will fit on the tree, and then to trim the planks and tree branches to the specifications that will fit on the tree, did we record some success on the project. <br><br>Similarly, marriage is not a haphazard project that one jumbles into to do guess works. It requires some careful preparation and planning. It is like building a house, it takes some planning starting with deciding what the marriage will be founded upon so that its architectural plan can have the best details.

</div><div>So how can one start to build a strong relationship? Like constructing a treehouse, building a strong relationship that will result in a glorious marriage takes some careful actions.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>The ideal dream: <br></strong>It all starts with a dream of the ideal life we desire. My friend and I dreamt of a treehouse where we could take naps when bored and we had a pictorial vision of what it will look like in mind.Similarly, couples aspiring to go into marital relationship must have an mental dream of the ideal home they wish to build. The passion for this dream must be so strong enough to push them into actualizing it.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>The architectural plan: <br></strong>At this juncture some pertinent questions must be answered: "what will it take to achieve the ideal dream"? It is time to put the mental vision into pictorial sketch in an architectural framework. This helps us understand the possibility of the dream and the materials needed for its actualization. Architectural plans can be simple and can also get really complex like the Burj Al Arab, but no matter how complex, they all serve the same job to shape a structure in the safest habitable waySimilarly, every intending couple must bring their dreams to the table of reality. That is they must ask themselves some pertinent questions. What is the plan? Am I fit for the marital dream? Do I have what it takes? If not, what must I do more?</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>The architectural design: <br></strong>The architectural plan for the tree house project was very simple and straight to the point. The major essence of the design was to guide the construction and ensure the builders don’t deviate from the desired design. Every detail has been put into design according to the purpose for which the structure is being put up and so must the construction be done.So also couples design marriage may be as simple as possible. It could be a design that ensures the couples remain friends no matter what. It could just be a book of rules between the two engaged individuals to ensure no one crosses outside the line of the marital structure. It could go complex embargo barring certain activities between both partners. Whatever it is, the design that works for Mr. A may not work for Mr. B, so it is pertinent for Mr. B (and/or A) to understand the best design or structure that works best for them in their relationship.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>In the bush: <br></strong>This was the time we went to a nearby bush to get the needed materials (tree cuts, branches etc) for our construction. It was the time for pruning, trimming, and gathering the desired materials for construction. Similarly, this is the time for couples to seek to acquire the right attitude, and character needed for the relationship.</div><br><div>In the next article we will delve into the construction phase!</div></h3>
